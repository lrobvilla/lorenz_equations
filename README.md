## Lorenz system of equation

This is an implementation and optimization of the code presented by the user Hevenicio [here](https://github.com/Hevenicio/3D-Lorenz-Attractor-simulation-with-python). The present version of this code was writted (except for the english comments) as part of a project for my differential equations course back in 2021; the investigation project(in spanish) can be found as one of the files.

The differences between this code and the one that served as inspiration are basicaly 2:
1. I'm plotting several solutions with different initial conditions to explicitely show the sensitivity to initial conditions of this caotic system.
2. I'm plotting every "trajectory" only once and then i update the code in every step instead of plotting in every step.

An explanation of the basic theory concerning this system of equation can be found in the pdf file.
